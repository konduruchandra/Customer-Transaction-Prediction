# Customer-Transaction-Prediction
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview:
The Customer Transaction Prediction project aims to predict whether a customer will make a future transaction based on their past behavior and profile attributes. Using machine learning techniques, this project analyzes historical transaction data, preprocesses it, builds predictive models, and selects the best-performing model for deployment.

ðŸ“‚ Project Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing & Analysis

Loaded dataset and explored structure.

Handled missing values and outliers.

Encoded categorical variables and scaled numerical features.

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand feature relationships.

2. Model Development & Training

Split data into training and testing sets.

Implemented multiple ML algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Applied hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV.

3. Model Evaluation & Selection:Evaluated models using metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.

Selected the best-performing model for final predictions.

Saved the trained model for future use.
